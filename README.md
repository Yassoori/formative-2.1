# Foundation Coding
### Formative 1

The code in this app is broken.  

Your task is to try and fix it.

You shouldn't need to add any lines of new code but rather edit what is already there.

If you successfully solve it, well done.  

If you don't then keep trying to figure out what is wrong with it and try again.

Hint: use console logs to find out where the code is running up to and breaking.
